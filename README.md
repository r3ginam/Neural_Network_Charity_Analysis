# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
This project seeks to help the Alphabet Soup foundation predict where to make investments. Using machine learning and neural networks, a binary classifier was created that is capable of predicting whether they will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? The target is the predicted outcome, which in this case is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column. 

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? The features are all of the variables used to make a prediction which include all of the following: APPLICATION_TYPE,AFFILIATION,CLASSIFICATION,USE_CASE,ORGANIZATION,STATUS,INCOME_AMT,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS,ASK_AMT

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the dataset because they do not influence the dataset. They are just used as identifiers.


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
