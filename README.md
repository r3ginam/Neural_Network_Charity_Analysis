# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
This project seeks to help the Alphabet Soup foundation predict where to make investments. Using machine learning and neural networks, a binary classifier was created that is capable of predicting whether they will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

  * The target is the predicted outcome, which in this case is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column. 

  * The features are all of the variables used to make a prediction which include all of the following: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

* EIN and NAME were removed from the dataset because they are identifiers, rather than variables.


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
